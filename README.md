# Project χ PCA Visualization

## About Project χ

This website was built using the [Project χ platform](https://github.com/Hypercubed/Project-chi). Project χ (pronounced project kai or /<abbr title="/ˈ/ primary stress follows">ˈ</abbr><abbr title="'k' in 'kind'">k</abbr><abbr title="/iː/ long 'e' in 'bead'">iː</abbr>/) is an modular open source visualization gallery framework built by Jayson Harshbarger at the [RIKEN Institute in Yokohama Japan](http://www.yokohama.riken.jp/english/).  It offers a framework and toolset for building self-hosted data-centric visualization websites. Geared towards sharing of supplemental materials associated with scientific publications; Project χ allows visitors to interact with visualizations, download associated data and images, and even try the visualization with their own uploaded or publicly available datasets.  For developers the framework comes packaged with tools necessary for quickly integrating interactive visualizations using [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), and [BioJS](http://biojs.io/). More information can be found [here](https://github.com/Hypercubed/Project-chi#readme).
